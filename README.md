<a href="https://velvety-heliotrope-01b838.netlify.app/"> Want to see live preview  </a>

## What is NNNOW?
As you might have seen https://www.nnnow.com/, It is an online portal with a very large collection of cosmetics, skincare, hair care & fragrances. It showcases some of the best products from the leading brands in the world at the best price.

In this project we have tried to a perfect clone of the original website as much as possible with very limited knowledge of front-end & back-end.
This entire journey of making the project was awesome. We learned lots of things by applying to the real website and it gave us a lot of confidence.
