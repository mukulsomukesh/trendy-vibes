# Limitations

This Website is fully responsive .

# End Notes

In this project we have tried to a perfect clone of the original website as much as possible with very limited knowledge of front-end & back-end.
This entire journey of making the project was awesome. We learned lots of things by applying to the real website and it gave us a lot of confidence.
